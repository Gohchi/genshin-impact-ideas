# Genshin Impact Ideas

The goal of this document is to compile some mechanics that would improve the experience in the game.

## Fishing

The fishing system would be ideal for a relaxing time (as main idea)

### Inventory / Tools
An option would be needed for the tools that could also be used by other non-fishing tools.
In this option the following item types would be displayed:
- Fishing rods
- Hooks
- Baits
- Threads / Sedales

### how to start fishing
In order to fish, at least one valid combination of the items listed above is required to be equipped.
Then go to some fishing area. A pier, some deep shore, from a boat, etc.

### Fishing mechanics
Once in position, aim to the direction and holds down to launch. The distance is defined by the amount of thread and the limit of the reed. (improvable)

When a fish bites the hook, the player has to rotate (in case the rod uses a reel) with one hand, and with the other give direction to the sides or backwards.
In this process, in case of failure, the line can be cut and/or the hook and/or bait may be lost.

In case of success, the player can choose to return the fish to the water or not. In both cases, these are recorded in a collection encyclopedia.
If the fish is not returned to the water, it becomes cooking ingredients.

### Collection encyclopedia
Although the idea is to collect, it also serves as a database. Name, locations, observations. But they would also record the weight, size, and date. In multiplayer, this information could be shared.

### Events
Fishing competitions could be held. (to detail)

## Cuisine

The game already has the option to cook. But this idea is a little different, since the current one does not have a visual process about food. And what defines the result is a reaction meter.
I think that in some kitchens in particular, special dishes could be prepared. These would be done step by step, and each ingredient would have its own way of being prepared (and executed).

### Cuisine mechanics
Once the dish to be prepared has been selected, the kitchen is shown with the ingredients ready to be processed. The kitchen will have its different sections and a task list could be displayed as a guide. Such as: Cutting vegetables, meats, etc. Put the ingredients in pots, pans, fryers, oven, etc.

### Types of dishes
The idea would be to prepare free dishes. The ingredients would be those that would give the values to the dish. It would be necessary to evaluate how to limit these. That is why there would be no specific types of dishes.

### Presentation
In the end the dish could be visualized in detail. The idea is that the plate looks as real as possible. For example: if you used a sauce, let it have the color of it. If you used shrimp, keep them in plain sight. Many of these materials will be obtained from both fishing and hunting.

## Hunting

The game already has a minimal hunting mode. The idea would be to expand the fauna and make it particular to regions, as it is already with the flora of some types.

### Hunting mechanics
The animals are defeated with a single blow. The idea is to change this to make the process more dynamic. Allow the use of different elements to facilitate the hunt of a particular type. Evaluate group hunting for more complex types.
It could even be thought of as an expedition for the rarest as it works with Domains.

### Collection encyclopedia
It would be ideal to have a record of achievements similar to that of fishing.


## Notes:

### 2020-10-25:
The first three mechanics that come to mind are: **Fishing**, **Cooking** (more complex than the current one) and **Hunting**.
